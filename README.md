## Hi community Github  

My name is Cristian!!!, I am interested in contributing to the tech world, since some time ago I rediscovered this passion that I love and motivates me to dream about my first job in IT.

I'm finishing my studies at Henry, a very complete bootcamp that taught me the most robust technologies in the market such as: JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Redux, Sequelize, Express.js, PostgresSQL, among others. I am very encouraged to continue in the line of learning to achieve greater goals.

I consider myself a curious and ambitious person, I love to follow good leaders to learn and become one day like them. If you are looking for a proactive person who is eager to grow in the industry.
